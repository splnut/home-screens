## Features

- **42 built-in modules** — clock (18 views), calendar, weather (8 views), countdown, dad jokes, text (rich with gradient/marquee), image, video (library file, direct URL, or YouTube link), quote, todo, sticky note, greeting, news, stock ticker, crypto, word of the day, this day in history, moon phase, sunrise/sunset, photo slideshow (photos, videos, or both), QR code (custom + WiFi), year progress, traffic/commute, sports scores, air quality, todoist, rain map, multi-month calendar, garbage day, standings (12 leagues), affirmations (4 views), date (5 views), display control (touch widget for wake/sleep/brightness/navigation), meal planner (5 views), chore chart (5 views), iframe, icon (Font Awesome picker), shape & divider (15 views), and 4 fullscreen modules — fullscreen calendar (5 views), fullscreen chore chart, fullscreen meal planner, and fullscreen photo viewer
- **Drag-and-drop editor** — visually arrange modules on a configurable canvas
- **Multi-screen rotation** — cycle through screens with 8 transition effects
- **Multi-display hub-and-spoke** — one hub Pi can drive several physical displays, each with its own screens, dimensions, rotation, and active profile; spoke Pis are adopted from the editor and can be targeted individually from `/remote`
- **9 weather providers** — OpenWeatherMap, WeatherAPI, Pirate Weather, NOAA (free, US), Open-Meteo (free, global), Yr.no (free, global), SMHI (free, Nordic), Met Office (free, UK), Environment Canada (free, Canada)
- **Plugin system** — extend with custom modules via runtime-loaded plugins, installable from a URL or uploaded bundle ([template](https://github.com/home-screens/home-screens-plugin-template), [example](https://github.com/home-screens/home-screens-plugin-standings))
- **Profile system** — named screen groups with schedule-based auto-activation
- **Remote display control** — wake, sleep, brightness, navigation, and alerts via HTTP
- **Per-module scheduling** — show or hide modules by day of week and time window
- **Conditional module visibility** — show or hide any module based on live values published by plugins (e.g. a Home Assistant sensor), with and/or/not condition logic in the editor
- **Google Calendar, iCloud + iCal** — display events from Google Calendar (OAuth device flow), your iCloud calendars (sign in with an app-specific password, contact birthdays included), or any iCal/ICS feed
- **Background management** — upload images and videos, browse Unsplash or NASA APOD, or pull from an Immich library or iCloud shared album, with auto-rotation
- **Per-module styling** — opacity, blur, colors, fonts, border radius, padding
- **System management** — upgrade, rollback, backup/restore, power control, and network settings (WiFi scan/connect, IP/hostname, diagnostics) from the UI
- **Raspberry Pi kiosk** — one-command setup with boot splash, auto-login, and display orientation
- **Password-protected editor** — optional authentication for the configuration interface
- **Multi-language UI** — ships in 7 languages: English, German, French, Spanish, Dutch, Brazilian Portuguese, and Danish; date and number formatting can be locked to a separate locale
- **Opt-in update notifications** — toggle a per-tag toast in the editor and banner on `/remote` when a newer release is on GitHub
- **No cloud required** — all data stored locally as JSON, no accounts or external services needed

## Quick Start

### Raspberry Pi

Built for [Raspberry Pi OS Lite 64-bit (Trixie)](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/operating-systems/). Desktop also works.

```bash
sudo apt install git
git clone https://github.com/home-screens/home-screens.git

# Raspberry Pi OS Lite (default)
~/home-screens/scripts/install.sh

# Raspberry Pi OS with Desktop
~/home-screens/scripts/install.sh --desktop

# Custom port (default is 3000)
~/home-screens/scripts/install.sh --port 8080

# Pin a specific release tag instead of the latest
~/home-screens/scripts/install.sh --version v1.3.0

# Display-only spoke (no Node, kiosk only — points at a hub Pi)
~/home-screens/scripts/install.sh --display-only --backend http://home-screens.local:3000
```

The script installs Node.js 22, Chromium, system dependencies, creates the systemd service, and configures the kiosk with display orientation. Reboot to start:

```bash
sudo reboot
```

### Local Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/home-screens/home-screens.git
cd home-screens
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then visit:
- `http://localhost:3000/editor` — configure your screens
- `http://localhost:3000/display` — fullscreen display view

### Docker

```bash
git clone https://github.com/home-screens/home-screens.git
cd home-screens
docker compose up -d --build
```

Runs the server (editor + display) in a container, independent of the Pi
kiosk pieces. See [docs/DOCKER.md](docs/DOCKER.md) for persistent data,
custom ports, and updating.

## Configuration

All API keys and credentials are managed through the editor UI at **Settings > API keys**. No `.env.local` file needed. Configuration is stored as a single JSON file (`data/config.json`) — no database.

### Google Calendar

Uses **OAuth 2.0 Device Flow** — authorize from any device, no redirect URI required:

1. [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com) > **APIs & Services > Credentials** > Create OAuth Client ID
2. Application type: **TVs and Limited Input devices**
3. Enter Client ID and Secret in **Settings > API keys**
4. Enable the **Google Calendar API** in APIs & Services > Library
5. **Settings > Calendar > Sign in with Google** — enter the code at `google.com/device`

### iCloud Calendar

Sign in with an **app-specific password** — no public sharing links needed:

1. Create an app-specific password at [account.apple.com](https://account.apple.com) > **Sign-In and Security > App-Specific Passwords**
2. In **Settings > Calendar > iCloud Accounts**, add your Apple ID and the app-specific password (multiple accounts supported)
3. Pick which calendars to show — Apple's calendar colors carry over, and you can add a birthdays calendar built from your contacts

### iCal Feeds

Add any iCal/ICS URL in **Settings > Calendar** — works with Outlook, Fastmail, and any service that provides an ICS subscription URL.

## Multi-Display Setup

Home Screens runs in two modes. A normal install is a single Pi that serves and renders its own display — nothing changes for that case, and the rest of this section is optional.

For more than one screen, pick one Pi as the **hub** (the one running Next.js) and install additional **spoke** Pis as kiosks pointed at it. Each display owns its own screens, dimensions, rotation, and active profile — a portrait kitchen touchscreen and a landscape living-room TV can coexist on one hub without squashing each other.

### Add a spoke Pi

On the new Pi:

```bash
sudo apt install git
git clone https://github.com/home-screens/home-screens.git

# Install kiosk only — no Node.js, no server
~/home-screens/scripts/install.sh --display-only --backend http://home-screens.local:3000

# Or pin a specific display ID instead of the auto-generated one
~/home-screens/scripts/install.sh --display-only --backend http://hub:3000 --display-id kitchen
```

The `--display-only` flag installs just Chromium, labwc, wtype, wlr-randr, and fonts — no Node.js, no release tarball. The Pi auto-generates a display ID from its hostname (e.g. `home-screens-hysd`) unless you pass `--display-id`. Reboot and it will boot straight to a "Connecting…" splash, then auto-launch into the real display URL the moment the hub answers.

### Adopt the spoke

On the hub, open the editor and go to **Settings > Per display > All displays**. Any spoke that's powered on and pointed at this hub shows up in the unadopted list — click to adopt it, give it a name, and pick its resolution and rotation. The display appears in the editor's **Display Switcher** pill in the toolbar so you can flip between which display you're editing, and in the sidebar's **Per display** group as its own drill-down page with Overview and Overrides sub-tabs.

Each display card has an **Edit screens** shortcut, an online/offline dot driven by live heartbeats, and the spoke's reported viewport — including its source IP — so you can tell which physical Pi is reporting at a glance.

### Targeting from /remote

The `/remote` page gets a segmented **Display Picker** at the top (All / Kitchen / Bedroom / etc.) when more than one display is registered. Brightness, profile switching, alerts, and next/prev/wake/sleep all target the selected display, or broadcast to **All**.

### Stranded-URL recovery

If a kiosk ends up stuck on a deleted display URL, it shows a 60-second countdown and a **Go to default display now** button, then auto-navigates to the current default. No power cycle needed.

## Managing the Pi

### SSH Access (Pre-Built Image)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Hostname** | `home-screens.local` |
| **Username** | `hs` |
| **Password** | `screens` |

```bash
ssh hs@home-screens.local
passwd  # change the default password
```

### Service Management

```bash
sudo systemctl start home-screens     # start the server
sudo systemctl stop home-screens      # stop server + kiosk
sudo systemctl status home-screens    # check status
journalctl -u home-screens -f         # view logs
```

### Backups

Your data lives in `data/` (`/opt/home-screens/current/data/` on the Pi):

| File | Contents |
|---|---|
| `config.json` | Screen layouts, module settings, display configuration |
| `secrets.json` | API keys (weather, Unsplash, Todoist, TomTom, etc.) |
| `meals.json` | Saved meals and weekly meal plan |
| `chores.json` | Chore completions, assignments, and history |
| `rewards.json` | Kid rewards and redemption history |
| `auth.json` | Editor password hash and session secret |
| `google-tokens.json` | Google Calendar OAuth tokens |
| `plugin-tokens/` | Plugin account connections (OAuth and sign-in tokens) |
| `icloud-accounts.json` | iCloud calendar sign-ins (app-specific passwords) |
| `todo-state.json` | Checked-off state for interactive todo lists |
| `telemetry.json` · `audit.log` | Anonymous telemetry state and editor audit trail |
| `kiosk.conf` · `port.conf` | Display resolution/rotation and server port overrides |

The editor has built-in backups at **Settings > Backups & data**, but for a full backup:

```bash
# Copy off the Pi
scp hs@home-screens.local:/opt/home-screens/current/data/config.json ./
scp hs@home-screens.local:/opt/home-screens/current/data/secrets.json ./
```

### Custom Port

Default is **3000**. Change during install (`--port 8080`) or afterward:

```bash
echo 8080 > /opt/home-screens/current/data/port.conf
bash /opt/home-screens/current/scripts/upgrade.sh setup-system
sudo reboot
```

### Display Resolution

From the editor: **Settings > Screen** — adjust width, height, and rotation.

From SSH:

```bash
nano /opt/home-screens/current/data/kiosk.conf
# DISPLAY_MODE="1920x1080"
# DISPLAY_TRANSFORM="90"   (90=portrait CW, 270=portrait CCW, 180=inverted)
sudo reboot
```

### Forgot Password

```bash
rm /opt/home-screens/current/data/auth.json
sudo systemctl restart home-screens
```

### SD Card Longevity

Writes are minimized automatically: journal in RAM, zram swap, tmpfs for temp dirs, config written only on save.

## Adding a Module

1. Create a component in `src/components/modules/`
2. Add the type to `ModuleType` in `src/types/config.ts`
3. Define its config interface in `src/types/config.ts`
4. Add a default size in `src/lib/constants.ts`
5. Register it in `src/lib/module-registry.ts`
6. Add a dynamic import in `src/lib/module-components.ts`
7. Add an editor config section in `src/components/editor/PropertyPanel.tsx`
8. (Optional) Create an API route in `src/app/api/` if external data is needed
9. Add an E2E fixture row in `e2e/helpers/module-fixtures.ts` (plus a data stub under `e2e/fixtures/module-data/` if the module fetches data) — the E2E coverage checks fail without it

Or build it as a [plugin](https://homescreens.dev/docs/plugins) — no core changes required.
